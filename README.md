# Hi, I’m Kyle!
I'm a web developer using this space to run version control for projects and portfolios. I primarily work with Javascript right now, although I have worked with SQL, MUMPS, C++, and Java in the past.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced webpage manipulation using Javascript, which I am honing alongside my CSS and HTML skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects where I can make a difference! I have interests in the streaming and games space, but I would be happy to work on an application or site where I can provide tools to help users get what they need.
- 💪 I am currently looking for work as a web or application developer, if you have an opportunity for me please reach out!
- 📫 Reach me at my attached LinkedIn profile or at kylebduval@gmail.com.
